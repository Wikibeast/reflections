When you want to share! And backups are thumb-ups.

Automatically pulling from remote might disrupt your workflow in local. 

Branches are code copied within a repository. Clones are copied repositories. Forks are copied repositories within GitHub.

The advantage of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that you can go offline, run a diff between the files, and merge them in your own time, instead of having to reconcile the changes in the two files then and there as with a pull request.

Without Git or GitHub collaborating with code would indeed be more difficult. It would help to communicate more with other coders and designate who is working on what at any given time. 

It's necessary to work in a separate branch when you are collaborating so that you can create a pull request that others have a chance to review. It is also necessary when working by yourself when you want to make different versions of code.
