Automatically pulling from remote might disrupt your workflow in local. 

Branches are code copied within a repository. Clones are copied repositories. Forks are copied repositories within GitHub.

The advantage of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that you can go offline, run a diff between the files, and merge them in your own time, instead of having to reconcile the changes in the two files then and there as with a pull request.
