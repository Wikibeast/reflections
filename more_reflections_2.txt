You can use the staging are to make sure you have one commit per logical change by comparing it to the master with git diff --staged. You can look at those differences and attempt to express them in a simple sentences. 

Branches could be useful when experimenting or making new versions. They help give you a safe environment to try things without worrying about damaging the working master copy. They allow development to continue while a piece of code is in active use. 

Diagrams help you see how branches relate to each other beyond simple pointers. 

Merging two branches together creates a new commit that serves as the tip of the branch that was "merged into". We represent it in a diagram in order to demonstrate the lineage of the commits and better visualize the development process.
